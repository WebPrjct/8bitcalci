Division: Subtracting 1 from an 8-bit binary number.

Logical Operations:
AND Operation: Performing a bitwise AND operation on two 8-bit binary numbers.
OR Operation: Performing a bitwise OR operation on two 8-bit binary numbers.
XOR Operation: Performing a bitwise XOR (Exclusive OR) operation on two 8-bit binary numbers.
NOT Operation: Performing a bitwise NOT operation (complement) on an 8-bit binary number, inverting all its bits.

Shift Operations:
Left Shift: Shifting the bits of an 8-bit binary number to the left by a specified number of positions.
Right Shift: Shifting the bits of an 8-bit binary number to the right by a specified number of positions.
Arithmetic Right Shift: Shifting the bits to the right while preserving the sign bit (in signed numbers).
